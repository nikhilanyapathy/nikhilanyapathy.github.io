                            As a product designer for Toast, I designed several features for Toast's core point of sale (POS), primarily used by servers and managers in a restaurant, and for the kitchen display system (KDS), primarily used by kitchen and back of the house staff. I built engaging and efficient interfaces for them, helping them complete complex day to day tasks in a simple way.<br>
                            <div class="opacity-box">
                                <p><br><i><b>Below is a brief overview of some of the key impact driving projects I've worked upon at Toast. For more details about this work and my process, please contact me.</b></i></p>
                            </div>
                            <!--<br><ul><li>For the core point of sale, I designed a feature to give servers control over the pace of a meal. Prior to this, servers were unable to choose which items to send to a kitchen for a specific table in the restaurant. This was a major pain point and blocked several sales deals for Toast. I interviewed owners and servers to understand their restaurant operations and what need they were trying to fulfill with this feature, brainstormed and designed various workflows for which I conducted internal design reviews, and tested these concepts with the restaurant owners to gather their feedback. I worked closely with the product management, engineering leads and the sales team throughout this process.</li>
                            <br><li>For the kitchen display system, I worked on understanding needs of restaurant staff in organizing the food orders on their screen to enable smooth and seamless operations in the kitchen. I combined research efforts for 2 different but related feature asks, saving the team time and money in doing so, and interviewed restaurant owners to understand their needs for organizing and prioritizing their orders. Based on my research insights, I uncovered the real ask from the customers - which was different from what was being planned, and successfully helped the team modify its roadmap to cater to the real needs of the users.</li>
                            <br><li>As part of COVID-19 related efforts, given the focus on takeout and delivery, I designed an 'order pickup' screen which is a consumer facing screen showing the orders that are being prepared and those that are ready. The idea was to minimise human contact and enable social distancing in this time of need. This product was designed and deployed in 10 days!</li></ul>

                                <p>I designed a feature to enable the servers to select specific food items in a table's order to send to the kitchen, while giving them the control to hold items to be sent at a later time.</p>

                                <p>I conducted discovery research by interviewing customers to understand their restaurant operations and why they felt the need for such a feature to understand their true pain points. After synthesizing the data, I sketched and brainstormed different workflows while gathering feedback from product management and engineering as well as the sales team. Finally I tested concepts with customers to get their feedback and iterate upon them.</p>

                                <p>This highly requested feature (currently being built) is unblocking sales deals for Toast. It improves the time to place an order, as servers do not have to rely on extensive workarounds. It is the standard for full-service casual restaurants, which form 27% of Toast's customer base.</p>

                                <p>I conducted a competitive analysis of existing KDS systems, as well as discovery research by interviewing customers to understand what their expectations were, what it meant for them to mark an order as urgent, and different ways in which they wanted to arrange their orders on screen. Upon synthesizing the data, it was clear that the customers' ask was different from what had been planned for the product roadmap - they wanted a way to move tickets around by dragging and dropping them on the screen. While the engineering team worked on seeing if this was feasible, I also proposed an alternative design to the feature that was being planned - which was both technically feasible and also solved the customer's true need, tapping into both my engineering and designing skills.</p>

                                <p>I combined the research for two different but related feature asks, thus streamlining the design process and making it lean. My research findings saved the engineering team's time by dropping the planned feature as customers did not really feel a need for it, and helped them look at what could be done to solve for their true need, which was an ability to drag and drop tickets on the kitchen screen.</p>

                                <p>Due to restrictions caused by COVID-19, I was unable to directly talk to restaurants to understand the full context around it. Instead - we operated in a lean mode, trying to get an MVP out to pilot to consumers, and iterating based on feedback received. In lieu of primary research, I performed quick secondary research by doing a competitive analysis.</p>
