People don't particularly enjoy the whole process of selecting and giving a gift to a person, all the while hoping the person they're shopping for would not <i>hate</i> it. That's where Prezent comes in! We chose to design a solution for this fun and challenging space.</p>

                            <p>We conducted interviews with <b>14 individuals</b>, and asked them a set of questions in 2 different scenarios, for when they last shopped for a kid and for an adult. We used an <b>affinity diagram</b> for analysis. The key takeaways were the commonalities amongst the desired gift attributes (eg: wanting the gift to be unique and sentimental) and the goals different people wished to achieve with their gift (eg: wanting their gift to be useful). Some were specific to shopping for children (eg: wanting the gift to be educational). Further insights included how information about the receiver known to the person influenced their choices, and how they went about finding new information.</p>

This was backed up by anecdotal data from the interviews.</p>

                            <p>From the interviews and survey, Amazon.com was the preferred choice of platform due to the variety, reviews and fast shipping.

                            <p>From our research we determined the following that:-
                                <ul>
                                    <li>People did not find gift-giving for kids as stressful as they did for adults. This led to us pivoting to include a larger user group, but this time, focused on gift-giving in general and not specifically for kids. This was surprising to us as we had gone in thinking shopping for kids would cause more stress - and this is where conducting interviews with people regarding shopping for both kids and adults helped.</li>
                                    <li>One of the biggest pain points was gifting someone for whom they had limited information regarding - it was surprising to us that people cared a lot when in such a situation; despite not being close to the person, they were still sensitive about giving the right type of gift which was appropriate. They wished to know more about the person, but they did not want to directly ask the person - either in the spirit of surprise or basically uneasiness in asking directly.</li>
                                    <li>Shopping styles were varied according to the convenience level it presented for the user. However, in a lot of the 'last minute' gift shopping experiences, we found that they leaned towards in-store shopping due to the lack of time. They did also like the 'touch and feel' aspect to in-store shopping. The choices presented in stores and online sites alike were described as overwhelming by some users.</li></ul><br>There were certain key channels that we identified as being part of a successful gifting experience:-<br><br></p>

                            <p>Once we made the pivot, we defined our user group as customers who have limited knowledge about the people they shop for, but still genuinely care about purchasing a gift that matches their preferences. Some social contexts which matched this (but not limited to) were:<br><ul>
                            <li>Users who had decreased contact with certain friends circles</li>
                            <li>Users new to the corporate world and were purchasing gifts for their coworkers</li>
                            <li>Users who had newly joined a family</li>
                            <li>Users who have moved to a new place</li>
                            <li>Users who are newly financially independent</li></ul><br>
                            We built our personas to cover such situations and also across different shopping styles and goals as informed by our research.<br><br></p>

                            <p>For our "informed brainstorming" session, we came up with a wide variety of ideas for systems to provide a way to collect information about the receiver of the gift and help the gift buyer come up with ideas for the gift. Broadly, the ideas were categorized on the basis of whether the goal was collecting data on the preferences, or providing gift recommendations, or a hybrid of both. Our top three ideas were:<br>
                            <ol><li>Social media image recognition - Analyzing data from social media (images, hashtags, places) to build a profile of the preferences</li>
                            <li>Anonymous Messaging - Discreetly asking the gift receiver simple questions about their general preferences</li>
                            <li>Virtual Assistant - An in-store assistant to help the user figure out what a good gift for the occasion would be based on available information</li></ol>
                            <br>In our first round of ideation, we went for a divergent approach, by sketching out individually each of these ideas. We then discussed strengths, weaknesses and inspiration for each of the sketches as a group.</p><br>
