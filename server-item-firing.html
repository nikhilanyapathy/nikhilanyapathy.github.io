                            <p>Servers in a restaurant don’t have control over the pacing of the meal - they can either send or ‘hold’ <b>all</b> the ordered items for a table to the kitchen. But what if they need to control what items get sent when to the kitchen to be prepared? To get around this issue, restaurants have workarounds in place that are costly in both time and effort for the server, adding several extra clicks to place an order, leading to frustration and wasted time.</p>

                            <p>This is an example menu in a restaurant where a server - let's call them Bob - is putting in an order for a table. They add multiple items to the check, and even if they select a specific item, clicking ‘hold’ ignores the selection and places a hold on all the items (and exits the order screen). Bob is confused - they thought only the selected item would be placed on hold. No worries - they go back to the table - and hit send - the red items on hold should stay...held right? Nope, in for another surprise. The inconsistent patterns and flow through the point of sale makes Bob's job much harder.<br><br></p>

                            <p>Toast has a 'meal pacing' feature that allows restaurant management to divide their menu into custom courses (appetizers, entrees, dessert, dessert round two, dessert round three, super secret special off menu course - you get the gist!), and then sends the ordered items to the kitchen in batches, course-wise. One might think this addresses the need we're trying to solve for.<br>
                            This *still* does not give granular control. It also increases the effort setting up the menu on Toast's backend for the management, as well as for the server as they need to modify items on the fly - <b>a lot</b> of extra clicks!<br>
                            Take a restaurant without rigid courses like the one below. Bob wants to try to assign numbered courses (1,2...) to batch them together so that they can pace the meal. Peep the number of extra clicks to assign a course to an item on the fly!

That’s 3-5 extra clicks for every item. For 20 items, that’s 100 extra clicks and if the server is waiting 4 tables that’s around 400 and if they had 3 turns that night, that’s 1200 extra clicks.”<br>

                            Bob has to add a dummy item called 'Course 1', add items below it, and so on - finally they have to add a dummy item called 'FIRE COURSE 1' which functions as an instruction to the back kitchen.<br>Not only is this extremely complex for restaurants to set up, it messes up their stats and reporting ('why is the most ordered item of this month FIRE COURSE 1?'), and increases the time to place an order for the server (poor Bob!).<br><br></p>

                            <p>I conducted interviews with 4 restaurant owners/managers to understand their operations and how they intended to use this feature and dig down to the root cause of why they needed their servers to have granular control over the pacing of a meal.<br>
                            <ul><li>We anticipated restaurants with ‘small plates’ on their menu, like sushi/tapas being the primary use cases (since a lot of items get ordered, and they don't fit into rigid courses) but we uncovered additional use cases for this feature.
                            This included high traffic restaurants, like that in an airport; as well as restaurants concerned about the overhead of retraining staff.</li>
                            <li>Restaurants expected an item on a ticket to stay held. What's the point of the 'hold' option if it doesn't, well, truly hold the item?</li>
                            <li>Sending all the items on a ticket at a time was still a commonly used workflow in the restaurant.</li>
                            <li>For restaurants which had traditional courses, they did not find the need to have more granular control over pacing. The meal pacing feature worked fine for them.</li></p><br>

                            <li>Adding new items to a food order with already held items, and multiple scenarios based on different selection of items</li>
