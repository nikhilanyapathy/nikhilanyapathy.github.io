                            <p>ADP is an industry-leader in online payroll and HR solutions, plus tax, compliance, benefit administration and more. I was a UX intern at ADP (Alpharetta, Georgia) for the summer of 2018; part of the ADP Workforce Now team - a web-based human resources (HR) application designed especially for midsize businesses. I worked on different projects within Payroll Innovation (PI), a cutting edge redesign of the current payroll experience that aimed to redefine the entire end to end payroll process by enabling all functions of the process in a robust, easy to use and interoperable manner. My role involved UX design, interaction & visual design, research and information architecture work.</p>

                                <p>Payroll administrators need to set the payroll schedule for the upcoming year for their company by the last quarter of the previous year. This is a surprisingly complex task, as companies have complicated payroll setups and payroll practitioners have been using the same legacy system for decades. Payroll is a sensitive process - after all, nobody would want anything to happen to their paycheck!</p>

                                <p>I designed a solution for payroll admins to have an intuitive and easy to use way of reviewing the payroll schedules in a timely manner, make any changes as required, and have a clear, high level view of any and all changes made.</p>

                            <p>This is an annual review process where the entire payroll schedule for the next year is reviewed. Payroll admins receive an alert on the system to review the upcoming schedule around the end of the previous year. The submit date is when the payroll is submitted, and pay date is when it is actually paid out to the employees in the company. There are different pay frequencies - weekly, biweekly, monthly and so on. Bank holidays can have an effect on the dates - and there is a minimum processing time between submitting the payroll and the employees actually seeing the money in their account.
